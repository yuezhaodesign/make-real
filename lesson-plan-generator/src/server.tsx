    Here are some examples of lesson plans based on the provided inputs:
    
    Lesson Plan 1: Renewable Energy Explorers
    Grade Level: Elementary School (Grade 4)  
    Objective: Students will explore renewable energy sources, understand their importance, and collaboratively propose solutions to increase their use in their community.  
    
    Materials:
    - Tablets or computers with internet access  
    - Collaborative online platform (e.g., Knowledge Forum or Padlet)  
    - Videos and articles about renewable energy  
    - Chart paper and markers  
    
    Lesson Plan:  
    
    1. Introduction (10 minutes):  
       - Begin with a short video on renewable energy (e.g., solar, wind, hydro).  
       - Introduce the driving question: *"How can we use renewable energy to make our community more sustainable?"*  
       - Discuss the importance of renewable energy and its impact on the environment.  
    
    2. Group Formation (5 minutes):
       - Divide students into small groups (3-4 students each).  
       - Assign each group a renewable energy source (e.g., solar, wind, hydro, geothermal).  
    
    3. Research and Idea Generation (20 minutes):
       - Groups research their assigned energy source using provided resources.  
       - Students post their initial ideas and questions on the collaborative platform (e.g., *"How can solar panels be used in our school?"*).  
    
    4. Idea Improvement (15 minutes): 
       - Groups review and comment on each otherâ€™s posts, suggesting improvements or additional ideas.  
       - Encourage students to build on ideas and think creatively (e.g., *"What if we combined solar and wind energy?"*).  
    
    5. Synthesis and Presentation (15 minutes):  
       - Each group creates a poster or digital presentation summarizing their findings and proposing a solution for their community.  
       - Groups present their solutions to the class, explaining how their idea addresses the driving question.  
    
    6. Reflection (5 minutes):
       - Students reflect on the process: *"How did working together help us come up with better ideas?"*  
       - Discuss how their understanding of renewable energy improved through collaboration.  
    
    Assessment: 
    - Evaluate group presentations based on creativity, feasibility, and alignment with the driving question.  
    - Assess individual contributions through their posts and comments on the collaborative platform.  
    
    Additional Resources:
    - National Geographic Kids: Renewable Energy  
    - Interactive simulations on renewable energy (e.g., PhET Interactive Simulations) 
    
Format the output lesson plans in a readable format. Ensure that the lesson plans are engaging, interactive, and aligned with the selected Knowledge Building principles.
